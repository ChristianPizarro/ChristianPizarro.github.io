# About me
## My interests 
My hobbies include spending time with my friends and family, watching or playing sports, playing video games and reading.

I am very much absorbed into basketball and American football and will ride with my Knicks and Ravens to the end. 

Academically I am really interested in computer work and various sciences, like forensics and such. 
## Websites I Recommend
  - [Sleeper] (https://sleeper.com) - I love playing fantasy football and basketball, and Sleeper is an extremely user-friendly and reliable outlet in allowing me to play.
  - [Youtube] (https://youtube.com) - I find Youtube literally irreplaceable in any aspect imagineable. You can find a video of nigh everything to entertain or educate yourself at a moment's notice.
